I want to use MUD to build a local blockchain for debugging purposes and I prefer not to push it to a test blockchain. So, my idea is to run the MUD service directly on my machine. However, since MUD is based on TypeScript and the package dependencies vary across different systems, I came up with a solution. I plan to use the "`pnpm create mud@canary **`" command on the server to create a service and then only submit the modified contracts and TypeScript files to the code repository. When deploying the code on the server, I will copy the relevant code from the code repository to the folder generated by "`create`".

The synchronized scripts are located in the folder: 
```
packages/shell
```

To start the service, execute the following command within the "create" folder:
```
pnpm run dev
```
