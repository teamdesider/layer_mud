I want to use MUD to build a local blockchain for debugging purposes and I prefer not to push it to a test blockchain. So, my idea is to run the MUD service directly on my machine. However, since MUD is based on TypeScript and the package dependencies vary across different systems, I came up with a solution. I plan to use the `pnpm create mud@canary` command on the server to create a service and then only submit the modified contracts and TypeScript files to the code repository. When deploying the code on the server, I will copy the relevant code from the code repository to the folder generated by `create`.
